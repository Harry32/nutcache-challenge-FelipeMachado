# nutcache-challenge-FelipeMachado

API developed for the Nutcache Admission Test. The test was not completed in time, the result found in this repository was what was possible to implement in time.

## Solution
The API was implemented using a partial DDD. Due to the simplicity of the project, the application layer was not implemented, as well as the Cross Cutting layer. It was used a service-based database.

## How to run
The application has not been deployed yet. The execution must be through Visual Studio.

## Next Steps
Since the project is not finalized, here is the list of planned improvements for a minimum delivery.
- Unity Tests
- Global exception handler
- Docker
